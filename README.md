# Conflict Plan 

How will you be sure you are creating a safe environment?
- be respectful and thoughtful
- pause at the end of the conversation in case anyone has something else to say

What will you do when it encounters conflict?
 5 minute breather away from computers (everyone)
 come back and discuss the issue

How will you raise concerns to members who aren’t contributing?
approach and ask if they need help (lost)?
stand-up to discuss tasks, and how can we help

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
can we check-in about this
define the issue one on one or as a group
my understanding was this? What is yours?
how can I/we help?

How will you excalate?
If still not addressed have a team meeting to figure out how to support

When to call a meeting?
Anyone can call a meeting at any time.

What constitutes agreement on an issue?
majority rule
If someone feels strongly about something, we would hear the other person out before making a decision.
