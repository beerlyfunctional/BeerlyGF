# BeerlyGF
Brewery locator with gluten free beer information

# Project Name
Beerly Functional
**Authors**: Merry Cimakasky, Trey Herndon, Jesse Van Volkinburg, Juliann Talkington
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This site is being built so that users can find local breweries and as the app is populated find tasting notes on beers available at those breweries. The app has a special focus on gluten free beers, since there is limited information available about beers that meet this dietary constraint. 

## Project Domain

Problem. Beer drinkers need a simple way to find information on local breweries and the beers offered at those breweries. This is particularly important for beer drinkers who have allergies and sensitivities. Information on gluten free beer options is limited, so we hope to create a app with brewery information and tasting page where users can help populate information about gluten free options. 

## Getting Started

  step 1: Clone the repository
  
  step 2: Make sure npm is installed
  
  Step 3: In terminal/command prompt, enter 'npm i' 
  
  step 4: Create a '.env' file containing the following
        PORT=[port number]      
        DATABASE_URL=[your postgres database url (OS dependant)]
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=[enter your key]
        BREWERYDB_API_KEY=[enter your key]    

  step 5: Run nodemon and test routes and outputs.
  
  step 6: deploy to a online service like heroku if desired. make sure to add postgres to online service as well

# Conflict Plan 

How will you be sure you are creating a safe environment?
- be respectful and thoughtful
- pause at the end of the conversation in case anyone has something else to say

What will you do when it encounters conflict?
 5 minute breather away from computers (everyone)
 come back and discuss the issue

How will you raise concerns to members who aren’t contributing?
approach and ask if they need help (lost)?
stand-up to discuss tasks, and how can we help

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
can we check-in about this
define the issue one on one or as a group
my understanding was this? What is yours?
how can I/we help?

How will you excalate?
If still not addressed have a team meeting to figure out how to support

When to call a meeting?
Anyone can call a meeting at any time.

What constitutes agreement on an issue?
majority rule
If someone feels strongly about something, we would hear the other person out before making a decision.
